# 8051-code-burner
The steps to burn code to **AT89S52 IC** which is essentially a 8051 based microcontroller IC .

This is to guide you about how to burn code to ATMEL AT89S52 IC which is a 8051 based microcontroller.
There are two ways to burn your code
1. Using a Burner (a device that is used to burn code) called **USBasp AVR Programming Device** and a software called **ProgISP**.
2. Using **Arduino Uno** with the help of a software called **AVRdude**.
